 Digital Tic-Tac-Toe with OpenCV


â€¢ Built a digital Tic-Tac-Toe using Python and OpenCV for two players, enhancing accessibility and 
eliminating the need for traditional boards.


  
 â€¢ Created a Dynamic 3x3 Grid using cv2.line with pixel-perfect alignment and a nostalgic aesthetic for a 
seamless user experience.


 
 â€¢ Implemented Real-Time Feedback using cv2.putText to instantly display winners or announce a draw, 
achieving a response time of <1 second.


 
 â€¢ Developed a Win-Checker Algorithm capable of accurately detecting 8 possible winning combinations 
with 100% accuracy.



â€¢ Integrated Mouse Click Events using cv2.EVENT_LBUTTON and cv2.EVENT_RBUTTON for intuitive 
gameplay, validated through 100+ successful test runs.



ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe Game using OpenCV (Computer Vision + Python Project)
Designed an interactive AI-based Tic Tac Toe game using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy, where users draw 'X' and 'O' on a virtual board, and the system detects moves through live webcam input.

Utilized OpenCV image processing techniques including contour detection, grayscale conversion, thresholding, and bounding boxes to track hand-drawn symbols on a real-time video stream.

Created an intuitive 3x3 board logic with coordinate mapping and symbol recognition, enabling automated turn detection, win/tie checking, and visual feedback directly on the game screen.

Achieved 90%+ symbol detection accuracy with smart filtering and region-of-interest logic, overcoming noisy backgrounds and variable handwriting styles.

Integrated AI gameplay logic and end-game animations, offering a fun, responsive, and engaging experienceâ€”built entirely using Python with no external game engine.
